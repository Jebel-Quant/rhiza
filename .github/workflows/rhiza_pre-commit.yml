# Workflow: Pre-commit
#
# Purpose: This workflow runs pre-commit checks to ensure code quality
#          and consistency across the codebase. It helps catch issues
#          like formatting errors, linting issues, and other code quality
#          problems before they are merged.
#
# Trigger: This workflow runs on every push and on pull requests to main/master
#          branches (including from forks)
#
# Components:
#   - 🔍 Run pre-commit checks using reusable action
