# This file is part of the jebel-quant/rhiza repository
# (https://github.com/jebel-quant/rhiza).
#
# Workflow: Book
# Purpose: This workflow builds and deploys comprehensive documentation for the project.
#          It combines API documentation, test coverage reports, test results, and
#          interactive notebooks into a single GitHub Pages site.
#
# Trigger: This workflow runs on every push to the main or master branch
#
# Components:
#   - 📓 Process Marimo notebooks
#   - 📖 Generate API documentation with pdoc
#   - 🧪 Run tests and generate coverage reports
#   - 🚀 Deploy combined documentation to GitHub Pages
#
# Custom Environment Variables for Marimo Notebooks:
#   This workflow supports passing custom environment variables and secrets to
#   Marimo notebooks without requiring you to modify this file.
#
#   To use this feature:
#   1. Go to Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions (repository secrets/vars)
#      OR Settings > Environments > github-pages (environment secrets/vars)
#   2. Add secrets or variables with a MARIMO_ prefix:
#      - MARIMO_API_KEY (secret)
#      - MARIMO_DATABASE_URL (secret)
#      - MARIMO_CONFIG_VALUE (variable)
#   3. They will be available in notebooks as API_KEY, DATABASE_URL, CONFIG_VALUE
#      (the MARIMO_ prefix is stripped)
#   4. Access them in notebooks with: os.environ.get('API_KEY')
#
#   If you need additional variables beyond the ones listed in the workflow,
#   you can add them to the env: section in the "Make the book" step below.
